## context
The Puna region of Hawai‘i has a growing population of kūpuna (elders) who need
additional support and services. Our community group is seeking funding to
provide elder care programs, including health, wellness and cultural activities.

## requirements

   area. For each grant, include the funding amount, deadline and eligibility
   criteria.
2. Provide contact information for the grant administrator or funding agency.
3. Summarize key terms (matching funds, reporting requirements) that could
   impact our application.
