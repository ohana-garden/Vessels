## context
Many kūpuna (elders) in the Puna region require assistance with health, wellness and daily living. Our organization wants to develop a program that provides weekly check-ins, meal delivery and cultural enrichment activities.

## requirements
1. Identify and summarize at least three existing elder-care support programs or services in Hawai‘i that we can model or partner with. Include their contact details and key offerings.
2. Generate a draft protocol for weekly elder wellness visits covering check-ins, medication reminders, nutrition, cultural activities and emergency steps.
3. Produce a set of safety guidelines for volunteers when visiting elders at home (including cultural sensitivity tips).
